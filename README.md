# Crypto-PnD-Prediction-



Note: there is a duplicate column is_pump = is_pump_window, the latter is in case you want to make it a window (e.g. 10 minutes before or after) if it is not needed you can discard it.
 there are 338 PnD cases with around 28000 lines in each CSV, around 800 MB of data total. it is possible to aggregate these by time ( instead of one line per minute make it one line per 10 minutes).
 also i uploaded the code you can change it there instead of going over each CSV if you prefer but the download time takes from 10-40 mintues depending on the time intervals you chose.


HW2 - mostly done, parts written in red need to be changed according to what we do with the model. someone needs to read everything i wrote to make sure its not stupid.
